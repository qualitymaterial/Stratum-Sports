## 3. The Science of the "S-Tier" Signal

Stratum is a self-correcting intelligence backbone. Every signal we send is automatically audited against the final market closing price. 

*   **Tier A (Institutional Standard):** Signals that beat the closing price > 54% of the time over 100+ samples.
*   **Tier B (Pro Standard):** Signals that beat the closing price > 52% of the time over 30+ samples.
*   **Tier S (Elite Edge):** Reserved for elite moves beating the close > 58% of the time over 500+ samples.
