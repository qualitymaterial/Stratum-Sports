# 🛡️ Stratum Signal Integrity & The CLV Audit

At Stratum Sports, we don't sell "picks." We sell **Alpha**. 

To maintain institutional-grade transparency, every signal generated by our engine is automatically audited against the final market price. This process—known as the **CLV Audit**—is the backbone of our signal quality scoring.

## 1. What is CLV (Closing Line Value)?

In professional sports markets, the "Closing Line" (the price at tip-off) is considered the most efficient and accurate price possible. 

The only consistent way to be a profitable market operator is to beat the closing line. If you bet a favorite at **-3** and they close at **-5**, you have generated **Positive CLV**. 

**Stratum's primary mission is to identify moves that beat the closing line before they happen.**

## 2. Automated Signal Auditing

Every signal in the Stratum database undergoes a lifecycle of verification:

1.  **Detection**: A signal (e.g., `STEAM`) is triggered by 5+ books moving simultaneously.
2.  **Relay**: The signal is dispatched via Webhooks/Discord to our partners.
3.  **Settlement**: 60 minutes after game-start, our engine automatically fetches the final "Close" from the market leaders (Pinnacle, Circa, etc.).
4.  **Audit**: We compare our "Entry Price" (when the signal was sent) to the "Closing Price."
    *   **Success**: The market continued in the direction of our signal.
    *   **Failure**: The market reversed or stayed flat.

## 3. Trust Scorecards & Tiers

We use these audits to build the **Trust Scorecards** found in the Performance Dashboard. Every signal type is assigned a **Confidence Tier** based on mathematical performance, not human intuition.

### 🏆 Tier A (Institutional Standard)
*   **Sample Size**: 100+ documented signals.
*   **Accuracy**: 54%+ Positive CLV rate.
*   **Stability**: Low Noise (The edge is consistent over time).
*   **Action**: Safe for high-volume automated execution.

### 🥈 Tier B (Pro Standard)
*   **Sample Size**: 30+ documented signals.
*   **Accuracy**: 52%+ Positive CLV rate.
*   **Action**: Recommended for manual plays or small-cap automation.

### 🥉 Tier C (Emerging / Noisy)
*   **Status**: New signal types or low-sample markets.
*   **Action**: Use for "Market Intelligence" (watching the flow) rather than direct execution.

### 💎 Tier S (Strategic Target)
*   *Reserved for signals that demonstrate 58%+ Positive CLV over 500+ samples.*

## 4. Why This Matters for Partners

Most retail "betting tools" hide their losses. Stratum exposes them.

By showing exactly which signals are "Noisy" (Tier C) and which are "Stable" (Tier A), we allow our Infrastructure Partners to build **Execution Logic** that only fires when the mathematical edge is proven.

**Stratum turns institutional-grade data into actionable execution integrity.**
